* About This Repository

This repository contains the source files and configuration for generating my CV in both HTML and PDF formats.

The CV is written in Org mode and automatically converted to HTML and PDF using Emacs and GitHub Actions upon each commit to the main branch.

* How It Works

1. **Org File**: The CV is authored in an Org file located in the =content= directory.
2. **GitHub Actions**: On every push to the main branch, a GitHub Actions workflow:
   - Converts the Org file to HTML using Emacs.
   - Converts the generated HTML to a PDF.
   - Saves both the HTML and PDF files in the =public= folder.
