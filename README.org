* About This Repository

This repository contains the source files and configuration for generating my CV in HTML format using Org mode. The HTML version is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages, and the PDF version can be generated manually if needed.

* How It Works

1. *Org File*: The CV is authored in an Org file named =index.org= located at the root of this repository.
2. *GitHub Actions*: On every push to the main branch, a GitHub Actions workflow:
   - Converts the Org file (=index.org=) to HTML using Emacs.
   - Deploys the generated HTML file directly to the =gh-pages= branch for GitHub Pages hosting.
