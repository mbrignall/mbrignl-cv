\section*{ABOUT ME}
\label{sec:orgce5b469}

Over the past 5 years, I have honed my skills in the DevOps/DevSecOps space. I currently
work as a Cyber Defence Engineer as escalated Incident Response. We deal with reports/alerts
as broad as phishing/business email compromise to GuardDuty alerting or malware. I have a strong
interest in the software developement pipeline. I love learning, and use self development to
increase my understanding.
