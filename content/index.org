~Bristol, BS3~

* ABOUT ME
Over the past 5 years, I’ve developed expertise in DevOps/DevSecOps, currently working as a Cyber Defence Engineer in escalated Incident Response. I handle a range of alerts, from phishing and email compromises to cloud security issues like GuardDuty and malware. I’m passionate about the software development pipeline, utilising tools like Terraform for infrastructure as code and NixOS for system management. I’m always eager to explore new technologies, often using my home lab for hands-on learning.

A Linux enthusiast, I’ve spent the last two years exploring NixOS/Nix-Darwin to manage my development environment declaratively. Check out my [[https://github.com/mbrignall][GitHub]] for examples. I am familiar with command line tools, navigating filesystems and shell scripting.

For the past two years, I’ve also managed the website for the [[https://sundaymarket.marketmanager.app][Tobacco Factory Sunday Market]], using Django/Python on Proxmox, with CI/CD pipelines and automated deployments via Cloudflare.
